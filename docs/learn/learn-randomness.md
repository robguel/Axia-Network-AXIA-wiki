The organizational mission of the AXIA Project Team remains clear throughout the project lifecycle. This undertaking has been to build a blockchain with decentralized network capabilities to create a global currency that is trustworthy and has a measurable real value integrated into a broadening interconnected ecosystem, thereby changing the economic paradigm and connecting the citizens of the world. The goal for AXIA has always been about providing a better and more equitable path forward in the creation, preservation and transfer of wealth between individuals. 

Over the past five years, the founding team has built upon that vision by constructing the organizational and partnership model that has sought to deliver this valuable end-state to the world. The founding team has also made the early decision that they would not draw any form of fiat currency compensation from this project. They, along with other senior members of the project team and advisors, have agreed and preferred to only accept AXIA Coins, symbolizing the fact that the value proposition of AXIA exceeds that of their native currencies. 

Additionally, participants in every development stage of this project have either earned or purchased the rights to AXIA Coins in the same manner as any participant who will be acquiring AXIA Coins today and from this point forward. The AXIA Project Team has continually held the view that each participant be they a project team member, external platform service providers or one of the global participants is  fundamentally a partner of the AXIA Ecosystem and equally valued as a member of the community.
