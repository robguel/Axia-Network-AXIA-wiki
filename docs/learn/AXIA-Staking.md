Staking refers to the process of delegating a fixed amount of cryptocurrencies for a specified time frame in exchange for earning rewards. Staking has established itself as a viable alternative for people to earn passive income, especially in times in which the fiat banking system does not offer any yields at all.

AXIA has also introduced staking programs, but amplifies the rewards and benefits structure above and beyond what is available in the market today. Typically staking rewards are offered and compared in terms of an Annual Percentage Yield (APY). 

AXIA, however, offers a more  innovative and highly rewarding staking program that will benefit participants in a greater way. AXIA has commenced its staking program by offering much higher rewards in terms of APY than industry standard, but most notably AXIA staking rewards will be COMPOUNDED DAILY, hence supercharging the stakeholders total yield.

The longer a participant stakes its AXIA Coin, the longer it will not be a part of the circulating supply. Therefore making it more advantageous for both the network and the participant when staking is set in for longer terms. For the AXIA network, a lower circulating supply means that there is more scarcity, which is beneficial, and for the participant it means greater benefits from the high yield returns.

AXIA will initially offer several different coin staking terms for the AXIA Coin, all of them paying out high annual returns and all of them magnified by the power of daily compounding, as illustrated in the table below:
