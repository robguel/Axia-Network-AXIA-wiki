The purpose of the AXIA Treasury is to provide an even greater safeguard and reinforce the value of AXIA Coin with an additional layer of support for the AXIA Network and AXIA Coin holders themselves. The value of the network and AXIA Coin is enhanced by the value stemming from the ability to consistently expand the AXIA Treasury through decentralized activity. The assets held in the AXIA Treasury are made transparent to the public in real-time, at all times, and are always verified through the AXIA Real-Time-Reporting Platform. The information will be shared among the community. 

Based on the AXIA Real-Time-Reporting Platform, which is available to view through a web dashboard on the AXIA website, the native currency for the network AXIA Coin has established a far more secure form of currency, medium of exchange and store of value.

The AXIA Treasury will vary in size and volume over time, however the Total Supply of AXIA Coins can only decrease The key objectives of the AXIA Treasury is to provide balance, stability while supporting the continued advancement of the AXIA Networkwith an asset base that can over time.

AXIA is nothing like a direct-peg model used by stablecoins or traditional asset-backed structures. AXIA will not attempt to operate as either a synthetic (artificially manipulated) or fiat-like dollar. Instead, AXIA will utilize the ever-expanding decentralized AXIA Network and Ecosystem, along with the ATL, to expand the AXIA Treasury while decreasing Total Supply of AXIA Coins to provide a superior economic model in which even further value by offering complete transparency that is unprecedented for a digital currency, let alone any currency for that matter. 

Assets are placed in the AXIA Treasury when an exchange of assets occurs for AXIA Coin within the AXIA Ecosystem. In addition, when proceeds are generated from any of the AXIA platforms, applications or businesses as well as associated partnerships within the ecosystem, those proceeds are deposited into the AXIA Treasury. Furthermore, if there is a fee stemming from various forms of participation and activity in the ecosystem, the proceeds from tha fee will be placed in the AXIA Treasury. As the AXIA Network and AXIA Ecosystem continue to expand, so too does the ability for the AXIA Treasury to expand and add even more support for AXIA Coin and the network. 

A corresponding value of AXIA Coin will be burned based on the value of the asset(s) that has been placed in the AXIA Treasury. This means that not only the support in strength increases with the expansion  of the AXIA Treasury but it is further enhanced due to the immediate reduction in Total Supply.

The ATL acts as the link between AXIA Coin and the AXIA Treasury to create additional value, building off the participation and collaborative activities in the community. Anything that is transparent to the market, meets the stringent standards of the AXIA Real-Time Reporting Platform, and can be easily evaluated and verified by external auditors, nodes or the market itself, can be used to support the value of AXIA Coin. The benefit of this design is that AXIA Coin is not correlated to any one currency, commodity, market or economy. This results in producing the most secure currency in the market today, while simultaneously acting as a better store and preserver of value than has been established to date â€” a true safe haven.
