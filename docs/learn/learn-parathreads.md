The concept for the AXIA AllyThreads is for AllyChains to participate on a block by block basis in CoreChain security without becoming the actual AllyChain. This is done through economically sharing the deficit of resources of an AllyChain slot among several competing AllyThreads. Chains that otherwise would not be able to acquire a full AllyChain slot or do not find it economically sensible to do so, are enabled to participate in CoreChain's shared security with an associated fee per executed block. This further helps in off loading the slot consumption for AllyChains as this way we aren’t consuming a AllyChain slot but still are able to communicate with CoreChain.
