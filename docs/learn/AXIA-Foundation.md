The mission of the AXIA Foundation is to birth a network that is more inclusive and provides an economic system that not only brings more decentralization, energy efficiency, interoperability, productivity but propels individuals,organizations and project partners forward with greater opportunities for advancement. All of this, while staying at the forefront of innovation to continue to expand the AXIA Network and AXIA Ecosystem as well as launch a the native digital currency AXIA Coin which can be a preeminent store of value and a medium of exchange along with bringing blockchain technology to the mainstream. Further to this the AXIA Foundation will seek to continually support developers and project partners that collaborate and work with the AXIA Network.  As such, the AXIA Foundation operates as a non-profit organization, with the guiding principle that all activities and operations undertaken by the AXIA Foundation are in place to support the AXIA Network, AXIA Coin,  AXIA Ecosystem and the community. The core values of the AXIA Foundation are as follows:

It will seek to partner and participate with other projects, corporations, institutions, organizations and individuals that share the same values. The AXIA Foundation will continuously seek opportunities to work and collaborate with global partners who wish to integrate with the AXIA Network and Ecosystem, and utilize AXIA Coin as a store of value and preferred medium of exchange. Additionally, opportunities such as grants and other incentive programs will be made available to developers and project and network partners from a wide variety of fields to not only support their advancements to bring greater innovation to the industry, but  to further support, expand and bring additional value to the AXIA Network and its community.

The AXIA Foundation will establish the structure to build trust not only for the AXIA Network and AXIA Coin, but in the overall suite of interoperable AllyChains, and all applications within the ecosystem. The AXIA Network will either directly or indirectly connect all of these services and offerings through decentralized activity now and in the future. All future-state distributed services within the ecosystem and individual AllyChains are designed to extend the global reach of AXIA and provide value back to a growing and diverse community.

The AXIA Foundation is committed to providing complete operational transparency, and will publicly report all network activity and project information in real-time to strengthen trust between AXIA and the community.

It will also ensure the transparency, utility and security that network participants desire is in place  as well as the resources, operations and endeavors to support developers, project and network partners continue to grow over time. 

The AXIA Foundation has formed – and will continue to establish – connections with leading technology and security experts to ensure the technological architecture of the AXIA Network, AXIA Ecosystem and AXIA Coin will always remain at the forefront of economical and technological advancement and continue to evolve as everyday requirements change.
