When a child is born, their parent or legal guardian will be able to apply for a free birth benefit on their behalf. This benefit could involve AXIA Coin(s) held in an AXIA wallet registered in the name of the child. The coins could be staked for a specified time period. This would allow for that child, at a designated age, to assume full access to their AXIA Coin(s) as granted through a smart contract structure created by their family. AXIA Coin donations would be accepted for this feature, with the potential for corporate sponsorship and partnerships.
