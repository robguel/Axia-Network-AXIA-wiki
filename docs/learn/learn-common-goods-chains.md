AXtend is a bridge that supports Ethereum compatibility with the AXIA Network AllyChain environment. This enables projects and developers to continue to use the programming languages and tools they have become accustomed to but within a fast-growing, scalable Layer 1 chain, with far superior economics and technology. AXtend is another element that fullfiles the goal of establishing true interoperability among multi-chain. This provides a valuable addition to the AXIA Network and Ecosystem due to the fact there is the cross-chain smart contract capabilities. AXtend not only provides a new level of convenience for users and assets to exist across multiple blockchains but establishes more favourable options for existing projects.

AXtend is also compatible with the entire AXIA Ecosystem, block explorers, wallets, AllyChain etc. for greater flexibility and simplicity regardless of the chosen tools. Furthermore, developers are able to deploy smart contracts on the AXIA Network as an AllyChain that are compatible with Ethereum. Since AXtend offers an interoperability layer with existing Ethereum based tools, it will support all applications that were originally written for the EVM environment without friction on the AXIA Network
