# Bitcoin - Asset than a Currency
People buy gold because of its long storied history as a store of value. This has been sustained for thousands of years. Gold has been used as a unit of account and medium of exchange for so long and is why countries once linked their currencies to it.
Whereas some purchase Bitcoin based on some rationale of it being a store of value and/or hedge against inflation, most people are buying it because the price goes up, which just brings in more buyers.
Bitcoin, however, is not gold. It acts like any other speculative asset. It is not even a productive one.

When Bitcoin was introduced to the world in 2008 it was described as “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”. It would allow for payments to be made from one party to another without the need to use intermediaries. The payment could be made without the need for a “trusted third party” due to the fact that cryptographic proof was required.
As a result, Bitcoin becomes another tool for hoarding wealth. And the more people hoard it, the more speculative it becomes and the less desirable it becomes to be used as a currency. So, Bitcoin appears a lot more like an asset than a currency.
# Problems with Bitcoin
It is not the solution for what ails the global economy even though the gain in popularity of Bitcoin does at least work as a reminder to those who control the system that currency does not have to be their monopoly. It is a sign that an alternative can emerge against the autocratic tyrannical future. 
But what it does not do is address the root problems with our global economy. 

* It does nothing to solve the problems of inequality around the world. Eighty seven percent (87%) of all Bitcoin are owned by one percent (1%) of the network. These few individuals have become very wealthy, and all that increase in value is not shared. Although Bitcoin is technically decentralized, a very small number of people do have control over the network. The distribution of Bitcoin sounds just as unequal as the accumulation of wealth that has occurred for the top 1% for all other assets. Bitcoin has evolved into another system of unfairness supporting further inequality.

* Bitcoin is also incredibly expensive to mine, limiting access to it to the ultrawealthy or hedge funds. Furthermore Bitcoin is not environmentally sustainable and will contribute to the destruction of the planet. The more popular Bitcoin becomes the more energy intensive mining Bitcoin becomes. According to Cambridge University as of mid-2021 the annual power consumption of the Bitcoin network was estimated to exceed the entire annual power consumption of the Netherlands, a country of over 17 million people and one of the wealthiest on earth. 

* Bitcoin has other serious flaws due to the fact that it is not a productive asset. Bitcoin is volatile, has minimal utility and has no intrinsic or underlying value, is expensive and slow to transact, offers no service and offers no social consciousness. Finally, the past decade has also shown us that Bitcoin is subject to price manipulation and collusion by individuals with concentrated large holdings (whales). It is latecomers (generally average people) that suffer when markets fall and bubbles burst, these same people who cannot afford to lose. This does not sound like the solution our society, our economy or our planet needs.  

* Bitcoin was billed as a currency that could challenge the hegemony of fiat currencies which are issued by governments. It is a form of untraceable money that would allow people to conduct transactions anonymously. Perhaps most importantly, because Bitcoin was designed to have a fixed number of coins people could use without the concern over inflation debasing the value - similar to gold.  

* The reality is that Bitcoin has never really functioned as a currency. A very small percentage of Bitcoin transactions have been used for actual goods and services. Most Bitcoin transactions have been trades - people buying and selling it. And because so few use it as a medium of exchange it actually has only accelerated  the value.

* As the price of Bitcoin has risen the number of transactions has only increased a small degree and remains a tiny fraction of a percent of total credit and debit card transactions. Bitcoin is only as valuable to the degree that people believe it has value. People buy it with the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future - simple supply and demand economics.

* Ironically, the biggest problem with Bitcoin acting as a currency may be the very thing that is so attractive about it. It is the limit on supply. Because the supply is limited, it can drive demand, therefore, the price will rise. But if the belief is that the price will rise, then why would anyone use it to transact?

# Changing for the Better
While the past decade has seen the global cryptocurrency market grow exponentially as a result of the technical distributed network advancements within the industry, a high level of investor confusion and mainstream concern has arisen because top “digital currencies” are viewed as lacking an easily calculated intrinsic value – if any exists at all. This concern can best be expressed when reviewing the use cases that individual token projects have attempted to tackle, and the absence of a clear value associated with the ownership and utilization of any particular token. 

This obvious flaw triggered new forms of cryptocurrencies known as “stablecoins.” However, the current class of fiat currency-tracked stablecoins fall into the same category as fiat currencies themselves. Stablecoins may have theoretically been designed for price “stability,” but will no doubt be devalued against other asset classes over time. They will also be exposed to the same systemic risks of periodic instability of financial systems. There are far too many shortcomings and deficiencies with all of these designs to ever truly become a meaningful force in the market. 
The gap between rich and poor continues to widen and this division continues to intensify. People are feeling disenfranchised and left out of the system. There is a complete lack of opportunities to advance themselves. All this while division is amongst us is being exacerbated. 
The system is not working.

There is a need for a common purpose. A purpose that can mobilize people to change things for the better. The world needs a common cause that should be towards the greater good.
Humanity cannot significantly progress until the fundamental issues with money are fixed. The good news is that money is changing for the better.

It was just a matter of time.
