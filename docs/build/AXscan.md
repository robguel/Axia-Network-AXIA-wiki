## **AXscan**
AXscan is the utility to view, analyse the AXIA network. It keeps track of all the Blocks generated with the transactions done since the begening of time. It can also be used to search for any specific Block height or Transaction Id to analyse any transaction which has taken plave over the network. AXscan will further allow you to do multiple operations including the web AXwallet inbuilt to send receive AXC's. To maintain your wallet account using AXscan following guidelines are to be followed for safe operations:


## **IMPORTANT:Key Security**
The only ways to get access to your account are via your secret seed or your account's JSON file in combination with a password. You must keep them both secure and private. If you share them with anyone they will have full access to your account, including all of your funds. This information is a target for hackers and others with bad intentions.

Please review this page carefully before making your account so that you understand the risks of the account generation method you choose and how to properly mitigate them in order to keep your funds safe.

### Storing your key safely​
The seed is your key to the account. Knowing the seed allows you, or anyone else who knows the seed, to re-generate and control this account.It is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If you lose access to your account (i.e. you forget the password for your account's JSON file), you can re-create it by entering the seed. This also means that somebody else can have control over your account if they have access to your seed.

For maximum security, the seed should be written down on paper or another non-digital device and stored in a safe place. You may also want to protect your seed from physical damage, as well (e.g. by storing in a sealed plastic bag to prevent water damage, storing it in a fireproof safe, etching it in metal, etc.) It is recommended that you store multiple copies of the seed in geographically separate locations (e.g., one in your home safe and one in a safety deposit box at your bank).

You should **not store your seed on any kind of computer that has or may have access to the internet in the future**.

### Storing your account's JSON file
The JSON file is encrypted with a password, which means you can import it into any wallet which supports JSON imports, but to then use it, you need the password. You don't have to be as careful with your JSON file's storage as you would with your seed (i.e. it can be on a USB drive near you), but remember that in this case, your account is only as secure as the password you used to encrypt it. Do not use easy to guess or hard to remember passwords. It is good practice to use a mnemonic password of four to five words. These are nearly impossible for computers to guess due to the number of combinations possible, but much easier for humans to remember.
