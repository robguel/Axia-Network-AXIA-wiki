### Overview
The AXIA messaging app AXchat is used as the AXIA Testnet Faucet for interacting with TestNet. A Testnet group chat has been setup and a bot listens for incoming messages.

The bot listens for the 2 following commands:
```bash
- !drip <Address> - Send ${unit}s to <Address>
- !help - Print a help message`.
```
All other messages in in this group including p2p are ignored.

In order to test the **!drip** command the AXIA wallet-AXwallet-needs to be installed and an account has to be created to obtain the public wallet address.
