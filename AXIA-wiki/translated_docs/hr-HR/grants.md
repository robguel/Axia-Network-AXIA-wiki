The AXIA Foundation offers two types of grants:

- The [Open Grants Program](https://github.com/axia-tech/Open-Grants-Program) is our standard program, which offers fast funding of up to \$30k for initial grants and \$100k for follow-up ones. Applications are tracked transparently on GitHub and disbursed in cryptocurrencies.
- The [General Grants Program](https://github.com/axia-tech/General-Grants-Program) offers funding of up to \$100k per grant and covers all other cases, including private applications and fiat payments.

More information regarding guidelines, support, and the application process for each program can be found at the above links.

Accepted applications for both programs can be found [here](https://github.com/axia-tech/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md).

## Alternitive Funding Sources

### Treasury

The treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing, staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. Both AXIA and AXIALunar offer everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury. See:
