Welcome to the AXIA Wiki! This central source of truth contains guides for interacting with the core functionality. Our wiki has three main sections: Learn (for learners), Build (for individuals that want to build on AXIA), and Maintain (for people that want to maintain the network).

## What is AXIA?

AXIA enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment.

AXIA is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permission-less networks, private consortium chains, or oracles and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

AXIA is a living network with the core pillars of governance and upgradability. The network has an advanced suite of governance tools and, using the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) standard as a "meta-protocol", can autonomously deploy network upgrades. AXIA adapts to your growing needs without the risks of network forks.

> Note: If you haven't heard of Governance before, a great place to start is the [Governance page](learn-governance)

By connecting these axcs, AXIA serves as a foundational part of a decentralized web, where users control their data and are not limited by trust bounds within the network.

## Why AXIA?

Back in the early 2000's, when the internet was gaining popularity for the first time, the internet featured read-only, static, basic webpages. The online connected world at the time was only the beginning of virtual data, identities, and more. The internet during this time was also called the Web 1.0.

As social media platforms and online businesses began to emerge, the internet transformed into the Web 2.0. This upgraded internet, which we still use today, features dynamic, interactive webpages, where users can read and write information plus publish their own for others to see. This version of the web though, comes with downsides dealing with data control, privacy issues, and trust. This is where the Web 3.0 comes into the picture.

The Web 3.0 is taking centralized applications and turning them into decentralized, trust-free protocols. The goal is to transform the internet into a decentralized web, where users control their own data and identity in a trust-free environment. The Web 3.0 movement aims to remove intermediaries and build a trustless infrastructure.

## How does AXIA work?

The AXIA network uses a [sharded model](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)>) where shards - called "[allychains](learn-allychains)", allow transactions to be processed in parallel instead of sequentially. Each allychain in the network has a unique state transition function (STF). Based on AXIA's design, as long as a chain's logic can compile to Wasm and adheres to the Relay Chain API, then it can connect to the AXIA network as a allychain.

AXIA has a Relay Chain acting as the main chain of the system. Allychains construct and propose blocks to validators on the Relay Chain, where the blocks undergo rigorous [availability and validity](learn-availability) checks before being added to the finalized chain. As the Relay Chain provides the security guarantees, [collators](learn-collator) - full nodes of these allychains - don't have any security responsibilities, and thus do not require a robust incentive system. This is how the entire network stays up to date with the many transactions that take place.

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g. Bitcoin), AXIA has [bridge allychains](learn-bridges) that offer two-way compatibility, meaning that transactions can be made between different allychains.

The [Cross-Chain Messaging Protocol (XCMP)](learn-crosschain) allows allychains to send messages of any type to each other. The shared security and validation logic of the Relay Chain provide the environment for trust-free message passing that opens up true interoperability.

## Why should you use AXIA?

Whether you're a blockchain developer or if you're interested in taking part of [AXIA's community](https://AXIA.network/AXIA-ambassador-program/), AXIA offers a platform for everyone. This wiki offers a place for builders and maintainers to utilize [tools](build-tools-index) and for brand-new learners to dive into educational material.

## Getting Started

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to familiarizing yourself with cryptography, blockchain concepts, decentralization, networks, crytocurrency, and so much more. This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and is also a free course.

For brand-new learners of AXIA:

- [AXIA's original white paper][white-paper] is a technical summary around one possible direction of implementing the AXIA network. This paper uses rationale and technical details to support why this direction is beneficial. This original white paper also explains how AXIA's core components work together to build this decentralized network.
- [AXIA's overview paper][overview-paper] is an updated version of the white paper that describes the protocol in more technical terms. We would recommend reading this overview paper if you are interested in digging more into the protocol itself.
- [AXIA's light paper][light-paper] is a visual, easy to read, and less technical introduction into its blockchain technology. This paper dives into the components of AXIA but is understandable for both a non-technical and technical reader.
- [AXIA's specification][spec] is a Github repository that holds the latest AXIA Host protocol specification, AXIA's specification tests of the many components of the network, and the AXIA Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and explores how various processes function in the AXIA network. The AXIA specification takes AXIA's ideas and concepts from the light and the white paper but focuses on the technical specs of the technology.
- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos][teched videos]: These are great introductory videos that explain and demonstrate how to use AXIA and its [User Interface][ui].
- Reading [What is AXIA? A Brief Introduction][article] on Medium. There are also other great articles to read on [AXIA's Medium][p medium] or [AXIA Foundation's Medium][w medium].
- [Creating a AXIA Account][account generation]
- [Sending a Balance transfer][transfer]
- [Staking as Nominator][nominator]
- [Running a Validator][validator]
- [Setting an Identity][identity]
- [Creating a Proxy Account][proxy]
- [Making Proposals and Voting for Referenda][democracy]
- [Running for the Council][council]
- [Voting for Councillors][council voting]
- [Using the Treasury][treasury]

For brand-new learners of AXIALunar, AXIA's canary cousin network: To learn more about how to build and maintain on the AXIALunar network, please head over to our [AXIALunar Guide][axialunar guide].
